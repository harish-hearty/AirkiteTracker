               This project aims to develop an aircraft tracker website that allows users to track flights in real-time
               and provides detailed information about flight status, flight path, and estimated arrival time. The
               website will use various technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JAVA, JSP, SPRING BOOT
               and APIs to collect and display real-time aircraft data from various sources. The website will feature
               a user-friendly interface, allowing users to search for flights, view flight details, set up notifications,
               and save favorite flights. 
               <br>
               <br>
               The website will also display the current position of aircraft on a map, along with other
               relevant information such as airports, weather conditions, and flight paths. The website will be
               optimized for desktop devices, with a responsive design that adapts to different browsers This
               project aims to provide a useful tool for aviation enthusiasts, travelers, and professionals who need
               to monitor flights' status and track aircraft in real-time.

               The aircraft tracker website will be designed to provide accurate and up-to-date information to
               users, ensuring a reliable and trustworthy source of information. To achieve this, the website will
               use a combination of advanced algorithms and data processing techniques to analyze and filter data
               from multiple sources, including radar systems, GPS, and satellite networks. Additionally, the
               website will be regularly updated with the latest aircraft data, ensuring that users have access to the
               most recent information available. This project represents an opportunity to create a high-quality
               and feature-rich aircraft tracker website that meets the needs of a diverse range of users, from
               aviation enthusiasts to travelers and professionals in the industry.
