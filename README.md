# AirkiteTracker

This project aims to develop an aircraft tracker website that allows users to track flights in real-time
and provides detailed information about flight status, flight path, and estimated arrival time. The
website will use various technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JAVA, JSP, SPRING BOOT
and APIs to collect and display real-time aircraft data from various sources. The website will feature
a user-friendly interface, allowing users to search for flights, view flight details, set up notifications,
and save favorite flights. The website will also display the current position of aircraft on a map,
along with other relevant information such as airports, weather conditions, and flight paths. The
website will be optimized for desktop devices, with a responsive design that adapts to different
browsers This project aims to provide a useful tool for aviation enthusiasts, travelers, and
professionals who need to monitor flights' status and track aircraft in real-time.
